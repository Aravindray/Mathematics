### 4 types of number

1. ℕ **Natural Numbers** - a set of all positive whole number | $ℕ = { 1, 2, 3, … }$
2. ℤ **Integers** - a set of all negative and positive whole number including 0 (zero) | $ℤ = { …, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, … }$
3. ℚ **Rational Numbers** - a set of all negative and positive fraction numbers (including integers) | $ℚ = \{ …, \frac{-6}{5}, -0.357, 0, \frac{3}{7}, 3, … \}$
4. ℝ **Real Numbers** - a set of all possible negative and positive numbers | $ℝ = \{ −∞, 0, ∞ \}$

### Number Properties

**Properties and Law**

1. Commutative Law
2. Associative Law
3. Identity Property
4. Inverse Property
5. Zero Property
6. Distributive Property

Definition and Examples of Properties and laws

**1, 2. Commutative & Associative law:**

For addition and multiplication, No matter we change the order of number the result will be same.

Addition Example:
	a + b = b + a
	a + ( b + c) = (a + b) + c
Multiplication Example:
	a * b = b * a
	(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)

But subtraction and division are not commutative neither associative property

**3. Identity Property of Addition**

Identity Property of Addition is zero (0) it's special name is additive identity
